In java, javascript, C, C++, C#, and similar languages, you need to use an escape character to display certain characters such as new line or have " show up
inside a string literal. They are called escape characters because they "escape" from their normal useage.
All escape characters start with a \\ to tell the compiler that the next character should be interpreted differently than normal.
Here are some common ones:
  
  \n    New line
  \t    Tab
  \v    Vertical Tab
  \b    Backspace
  \r    Carriage return
  \f    Formfeed
  \\    Backslash
  \'    Single quotation mark
  \"    Double quotation mark
  \d    Octal
  \xd    Hexadecimal
  \ud    Unicode character
